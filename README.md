# ESP8266 Load Cell Project

#### Project Overview
This project uses an ESP8266 microcontroller along with an HX711 Load Cell Amplifier module to measure weight using a load cell. The weight measurement is calibrated based on the calibration factor specific to your load cell setup.

#### Components Needed
- **ESP8266 Microcontroller**
- **HX711 Load Cell Amplifier Module**
- **Load Cell**
- **Resistors (if needed for sensor circuit)**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Load Cell to ESP8266:**
   - Connect the **E+** and **E-** terminals of the load cell to the respective **E+** and **E-** terminals on the HX711 module.
   - Connect the **A-** and **A+** terminals of the load cell to the respective **A-** and **A+** terminals on the HX711 module.
   - Connect the **DOUT** pin of the HX711 module to GPIO pin D5 on the ESP8266.
   - Connect the **SCK** pin of the HX711 module to GPIO pin D6 on the ESP8266.
   - Ensure proper power and ground connections between the ESP8266, HX711 module, and load cell.

#### Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board support installed.
   - Install the HX711 library if not already installed (`HX711_ADC` library by Olav Kallhovd).
   - Create a new sketch and paste the provided Arduino code.
   - Connect the ESP8266 to your computer, select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the ESP8266.

2. **Operation:**
   - After uploading the code, open the Serial Monitor (baud rate: 9600).
   - The Serial Monitor will display the raw ADC value and calculated weight (in kg) measured by the load cell.
   - Adjust the `calibration_factor` in the code to calibrate the weight measurement based on your specific load cell setup.

#### Applications
- **Weight Measurement:** Measure and monitor weight using load cells in various applications.
- **Industrial Automation:** Integrate weight measurement into automated systems.
- **Data Logging:** Log weight data for analysis and record-keeping purposes.

#### Notes
- **Calibration:** Adjust the `calibration_factor` in the code to match the output of your load cell.
- **Serial Communication:** Use Serial Monitor for real-time weight monitoring and calibration adjustments.
- **HX711 Library:** Understand the HX711 library functions (`begin`, `set_gain`, `read`) for accurate weight readings.
